# StringsParser
This is a preliminary work for using the [strings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_(Unix)) (or strings-alternative) command in [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org).

## Getting started
This repository includes the implementation of the StringsParser, a parser that uses the strings command in order to extract ASCII strings from binary files.

Use build.sh and run.sh scripts (under Unix-like OS) for compiling and testing StringsParser.
